										<h2 class="major">Fitness Goal Helper</h2>
										<p>I built this app in my sophmore year of highschool. Though it isnt my prettiest app it reflects my desire to incorperate the technology I had into my interests and passions. I understood the limitations with making an app on code.org and was content with sharing this with all my friends via links, eagerly watching them use the app and test its functions. Though it didnt mean much to them it was a start, my humble beginings.</p>

										<p>This project doubled as my entry into the Congressional App Challenge. To make it, I chose to enhance my proficiency in code.org, a platform I was already familiar with. This decision allowed me to focus on exploring the database capabilities within code.org, which eliminated the need for me to integrate external APIs or deal with unfamiliar concepts. While working on this project, I had friends who also participated in the challenge, but they opted for more advanced and complex platforms in an attempt to create impressive apps. When I sought advice from a teacher, he wisely remarked, "You could certainly use a flashy platform with all the bells and whistles, but if you can achieve your goal with something simpler, then why complicate things unnecessarily?"</p>

									<h2 class="major">Practicum Class Projects</h2>
									<p>During my senior year of highschool, I took a course called Practicum where the class worked together to make apps for CISD using swift to solve problems in the various campuses and improve the lives of students and teachers alike through ios apps. We managed to get both apps on to the Appstore by the end of the year.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Student Central</h3>
											<p>This app was designed to be an emergency helper app for students masked as a convenience app. We offered basic information and tools which an everyday student may find useful while also providing information to get help from the authorities, and refer people to appropriate services based on their needs.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Crisis Management</h3>
											<p>The problem? Teachers had to go through pages and pages of printouts of every emergency resource to help students who reach out to them. This app seeked to change that by providing teachers a way to refer students to a counceler if the problem is beyond them, a documented and organized resource page, and a page for emergency contacts teachers can refer to in the appropriate situations. The app had to be able to help anyone with any level of training respond appropriatly to a student in need and had extensive care in coaching teachers through the stages of response as well as warning them about common mistakes made while trying to help the student. </p>
